# Logical modelling pipeline
Repository of the pipeline of computational methods for logical modelling of biological networks that are deregulated in diseases.

Full tutorial can be followed on the dedicated [Tutorial webpage](https://github.com/sysbio-curie/Logical_modelling_pipeline/blob/master/doc/Tutorial_Cohen.md) where you may get all the scripts, models, tools and Docker image.

All scripts can be found in [scripts folder](https://github.com/sysbio-curie/Logical_modelling_pipeline/tree/master/scripts), all tools can be found in [lib folder](https://github.com/sysbio-curie/Logical_modelling_pipeline/tree/master/lib), the models that we have used can be found in [models folder](https://github.com/sysbio-curie/Logical_modelling_pipeline/tree/master/models) and the Docker image can be found in its [Docker Hub webpage](https://hub.docker.com/r/arnaumontagud/logical_modelling_pipeline/).
